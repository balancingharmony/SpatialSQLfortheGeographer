Sample data and scripts using Microsoft spatial SQL. Code developed using SQL Server 2008 R2, but everything still works as of April 2016. Any suggestions or improvements are welcome.

All scripts and tables used here are based on the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc280487.aspx">GEOMETRY data type</a>

Data provided in the /Data folder to be used in script tutorials.  All data originally downloaded from <a href="http://www.naturalearthdata.com/">Natural Earth's awesome website</a>

A number of tutorials are available from GISDoctor.com
